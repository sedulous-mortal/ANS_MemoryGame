            Concentration, also known as Match-Match, Memory, Pelmanism, Shinkei-sujaku, Pexceso, or Pairs, is a card game in which all of the cards are laid facedown on a surface and two cards are revealed for the duration of each turn. The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards by remembering where the hidden pairs are located.
